            <h1>Lucy Zhang</h1>
            <p>I&apos;m a 4th year Software Engineering student at Rochester Institute of Technology. This site was created for a project in Web and Mobile 2. 
                The reason I chose to make my project on the city of Toronto is because it&apos;s one of my favorites places I&apos;ve visited. 
                Growing up in a small town, I was always fascinated by the allure of bigger cities filled with endless activities. 
                Toronto, just a few hours drive from Rochester, is the perfect spot for a quick escape from school whenever I need a change of scenery.
                Although I've only been to Toronto about 4 times, I plan on traveling there more in the future!
