            <h1>Hong Kong Island Bakery</h1>
            <img class="left" src="images/Bakery.jpeg" alt="Hong Kong Island Bakery">
            <p>One of my favorite stops whenever I&apos;m in Toronto is this bakery in Chinatown. It&apos;s the perfect place for fresh baked buns, cakes, and an array of delicious treats. 
                They feature a wide variety of pastries, ranging from sweet to savory ones. They offer a wide variety of pastries, both sweet and savory. In addition, you can enjoy 
                various drinks like coffee and milk tea, as well as hot foods like dumplings and noodles. Best of all, everything is affordably priced!

            <h1>Petit Potato</h1>
            <img class="right" src="images/Dessert.jpg" alt="Petit Potato">
            <p>With a sprawling 30-page menu, this Asian fusion restaurant offers more dishes than you can count. From traditional favorites like herbal soup to popular choices such as ramen, 
                there&apos;s something for every palate at Petit Potato. Open until 1 a.m., it&apos;s the perfect spot for a midnight snack or a late-night dinner with friends.
                <br><br>
                One of the standout features that drew me to this restaurant is their impressive dessert. Towering over a foot high, it showcases a stack of thick French toasts topped with a generous 
                scoop of ice cream and your choice of fruit or Oreos, depending on the special you order. It&apos;s a delightful treat that&apos;s as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the taste buds!
